I am a lawyer, but my qualifications are limited in a new country due to differences in the legal system.
At the same time, I have always been interested in the development of new technologies and would love to be part of this process. 
Learning the basics of programming will allow me to acquire universal skills that are in demand worldwide and apply my analytical thinking as a lawyer in the IT field. Additionally, understanding how programs are written would enable me to work as a project manager in IT companies. 
I am highly motivated to develop in this new area and ready to learn actively.
